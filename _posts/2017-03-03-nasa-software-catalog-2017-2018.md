If you've ever wanted to know what programs does NASA use, now you can. The entire catalog is [visible at this page](https://software.nasa.gov/), and I particularly recommend looking at the [Data Servers Processing & Handling section](https://software.nasa.gov/data_servers_processing_and_handling) because it has a few tools that might be interesting.
